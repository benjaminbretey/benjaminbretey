## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Benjamin, an aspring business analyst with experience on several technical projects within the TripleTen Business Intelligence program. I have demonstrated skill in using spreadsheets, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI.

- In my free time, I enjoy a variety of modern tabletop games that employ strategy, tactical cost/benefit decisions, resource management, cooperation, and communication. I find the social and tactile experience shared with others to be uniquely engaging. I also value reading cultural commentary, enjoying the outdoors, and making cookies.

- I'm currently working in retail at Whole Foods Market, where I contribute to their goal of "Nourish People and the Planet" through sincere customer service, encouraging and supporting my co-workers, and working with leadership to improve working conditions and methods.
- I took the voluntary initiative to become a certified Advanced Culture Champion within the company- learning about leadership, team building, sustainable foods, quality standards, and global efforts to improve food access and fight poverty through business micro-finance.  

My 15 years of work experience displays hardworking service and innovative initiative in every position. 
- While serving Frontside Cafe in Ventura CA, I undertook inventory control, facilities maintenance, and acted as a business contact in addition to regular food service duties. I collaborated with the owners to produce training material with methods I implemented in order to ensure smooth operations as business sales doubled over the course of one year.
- As an independent sub-contractor for Lowe's performing residential fence installations, I produced accurate job estimates, executed on multi-day projects, and maintained relationships between Lowe's, customers, and third-party suppliers.
- I spent 10 years being deeply involved in volunteer work at Bethany Farm Camp and Retreat, serving rural southwest Iowa. There I wore many hats: groundskeeper, facilities maintenance, building construction, musician, theater performance, counselor, parent liason, program lead, social media administrator, and teacher. I believe my instinct for initiative and proactive, collaborative problem solving was honed most keenly in this season.
- My first professional work as a grocer began as a teenager, where I moved through various roles until I managed the dairy department. I know even early on, I had a natural knack for analysis, logistics efficiency, and process improvement. By age 20, I gauged customer demand, merchandised profitable returns on thin margins, and managed a team of teenage employees handling fragile, short shelf life goods.

- I'm currently learning Python with a focus on Pandas and NumPy, in order to better equip myself in the field of business analysis.
